# QuickSort-and-Mergesort

There are two implementations of QuickSort and Merge Sort in both
Haskell and a language of the studentâ€™s choice. I had chosen to use Python for the comparison
because both languages have significant support for functional programming paradigms.
QuickSort is a sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the
input list into two sub-lists based on whether each element is greater or less than the pivot. It
then recursively applies the same process to each sub-list until the entire list is sorted. Merge
Sort works by recursively dividing the input list into two halves, sorting each half separately, and
then merging the sorted halves together to produce the final sorted list
